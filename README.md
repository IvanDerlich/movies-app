# Movie Browser App

This is a modern movie browsing app built with Next.js and Material UI. It allows you to search for movies and series using the OMDB API, view details, and enjoy a fast, responsive, and beautiful UI.

**Note:** Sometimes images may not load properly due to issues with the OMDB server.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a file called `.env.local` in the root of the project.
   - Add your OMDB API key:
     ```env
     OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key_here
     ```
   - You can get a free OMDB API key at [http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)

4. **Install MUI icons (required for icons):**
   ```bash
   npm install @mui/icons-material
   # or
   yarn add @mui/icons-material
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

6. **Open the app:**
   - Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How It Works

- **Search:** Enter a movie title and click "Search". The app fetches results from the OMDB API via a secure Next.js API route.
- **Filtering:** Use the dropdown to filter results by Movies, Series, or both.
- **Details:** Click a movie title to see detailed information. The details page fetches full info from OMDB using a secure backend route.
- **Caching:**
  - The backend caches OMDB responses for 1 hour to reduce API calls and improve speed.
  - The browser and any CDN will also cache responses for 1 hour, serving stale data while revalidating in the background for up to 24 hours.
- **Error Handling:**
  - User-friendly messages are shown for network errors, OMDB errors, or empty results.
- **Security:**
  - The OMDB API key is never exposed to the client; all requests go through the Next.js backend.

## Perceiving the Benefits of Caching

You can experience the app's caching in action by observing the loading times of movie poster images:

- **Try this:**
  1. Search for a movie and open its details page. Pay attention to how long the poster image takes to load the first time.
  2. Refresh the page or revisit the same movie details page in the same browser tab. The image should load much faster, as it is served from the browser cache.
  3. For comparison, open the same movie details page in a different browser (e.g., if you used Chrome, try Firefox or Edge). Even though the browser cache is not shared, you may notice the image loads faster than the very first timeâ€”this is because the server-side cache is now being used.

If you pay attention to the loading times, you'll notice the benefit of both browser and server-side caching: repeated requests from the same browser are fastest, but even requests from a different browser can be faster after the first load, thanks to server-level caching.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15 (App Router):** Modern React framework for server-side rendering, API routes, and routing.
- **React 18:** For building interactive UIs.
- **Material UI (MUI):** For beautiful, responsive, and accessible UI components.
- **@mui/icons-material:** For Material Design icons.
- **OMDB API:** For movie and series data.
- **React Context:** For global state management.
- **Modern Caching:** HTTP and server-side caching for performance.
